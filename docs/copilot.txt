 1. Start with a docs/ Folder
Create a folder in your project root called docs/. This is where you’ll keep all your documentation files.
your-project/
├── src/
├── public/
├── docs/
│   ├── setup.md
│   ├── database.md
│   ├── components.md
│   └── api.md
└── README.md



📄 2. What to Put in Your Documentation
Here are some beginner-friendly files you can create:
|  |  | 
| setup.md |  | 
| database.md |  | 
| components.md |  | 
| api.md | /expenses/add-expense | 
| troubleshooting.md |  | 



✍️ 3. How to Write It
- Use Markdown (.md) — it’s simple and readable.
- Use headings, code blocks, and bullet points.
- Example from api.md:
## POST /expenses

Adds a new expense to the database.

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "title": "Groceries",
  "amount": 500,
  "date": "2025-11-17"
}


- Response:
{
  "success": true,
  "id": 12
}
🚀 4. How to Share It- Keep your docs/ folder in your GitHub repo — others can read it online.
- Link to it from your README.md:
## Documentation

- [Setup Instructions](docs/setup.md)
- [Database Schema](docs/database.md)
- [API Reference](docs/api.md)
🧠 Why This Matters- Helps you remember what you did.
- Makes it easier to collaborate with others.
- Shows professionalism if you share your project publicly.
If you want, I can help you draft your first setup.md or api.md file based on what you’ve built so far. Just tell me what you’ve implemented.
